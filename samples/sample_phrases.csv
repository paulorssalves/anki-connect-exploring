Taking my dog for a walk is fun.
Walking in the rain can be difficult.
Strolling along a beach at sunset is romantic.
Getting a promotion is exciting.
Signing autographs takes time.
Going for ice cream is a real treat.
Singing for his supper was how he earned his keep.
Getting a sore back was the result of the golf game.
Pulling an all-nighter did not improve his test scores.
Sailing into the sunset was the perfect end to the book.
