"Many parents believe that sugar consumption causes hyperactivity in their children. Indeed, ‘sugar highs’ are often blamed for rowdiness or excitability – but is sugar the guilty party, or is it simply a case of ‘normal’ childhood behaviour? Several years ago, Channel 4, together with Jo Frost (perhaps better known as Supernanny) conducted an experiment to distinguish the truth. Forty children, aged six, were invited to a party and divided into two halves. One half was given typical sugary party foods; the other half ate sugar-free alternatives. Crucially, the parents of the children were unaware as to which group their child was in. (Incidentally, no artificial colourings or flavourings commonly found in sweets were present, since these have already been linked to hyperactivity.) Subsequently, as the children ran about and enjoyed the party, the parents were asked whether they believed their own child had been given sugar. The majority believed they had. Ironically, as the children then sat down to watch a magic show, most parents changed their minds. Basically, they could not accept that their child was capable of sitting still after consuming sugary foods. To conclude, the experiment suggested that there was no link between hyperactivity and sugar intake, but that the children were naturally excited because they were at a party."
"Exploring the world through travel has both positive and negative implications. On one hand, travelling can broaden the mind, introducing one to new cultures and experiences. It can offer a first-hand education of historical sites, plus the opportunity to appreciate the diversity of nature. Also, visiting different countries can increase one’s understanding of other people’s lifestyles and perspectives, therefore nurturing tolerance and open-mindedness. However, travel also has undesirable consequences. The impact of visitors can cause destruction to some of the world’s best treasures. For instance, Pamukkale, in Turkey, is an ancient site consisting of calcite travertines filled with mineral water from hot springs. It is a fascinating and unique phenomenon, yet has been under threat of irreparable damage by tourists walking on the basins and by hotels using the mineral water, causing the basins to dry up. Fortunately, measures were implemented to save Pamukkale, including the demolition of the hotels and the prohibition of shoes on the basins. Even the Great Pyramids have undergone restoration. High levels of humidity created by visitors resulted in a build up of salt, causing cracks. In addition, graffiti carved into the walls was removed. Summarily, the balance between tourism and the preservation of irreplaceable sites can be precarious."
"Sweeney Todd, the infamous barber, has become an intrinsic part of London’s gruesome history. However, there has been ongoing debate as to whether the tale was based on fact or fiction. Whilst it is known that Todd first appeared as a character in a ‘penny dreadful’ in 1846, there is conflicting opinion as to the origins of the story. ‘Penny dreadfuls’ were cheap publications of gore and horror; they were popular in Victorian London. Although generally accepted as fictitious, it is thought authors scoured newspapers and other stories in search of inspiration. Also, since news was mainly spread through word of mouth and subjected to embellishment, ascertaining the truth is difficult. Edward Lloyd, publisher of the serial in which Todd first materialised, apparently claimed the character was based on truth. Even so, lack of evidence has left most researchers unconvinced, putting the claims down to clever marketing. Despite this, many people still believe in its authenticity – author Peter Haining published a book claiming that Todd was a real, revenge-seeking man. However, no evidence supports his claims and the Old Bailey holds no records of any such crime. Whether or not the story does take its inspiration from any real event or rumour is uncertain. Yet, whatever the truth, the tale of Sweeney Todd continues to hold a macabre fascination, nearly two centuries on."
